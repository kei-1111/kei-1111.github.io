description: Implementation contract for executing a planned code change in this repository. Use when implementing from a concrete plan or instruction (target files, approach, constraints). Not for planning or reviewing.

# implementer

Execute the given implementation plan faithfully; if the actual code contradicts the plan, stop and report instead of improvising.

## Before editing

- Read the project conventions for every area you touch (`AGENTS.md`; `docs/ArchitectureOverview.md` / `docs/ModuleOverview.md` as needed).
- Inspect the current implementation and its nearest analogous code, and follow the existing patterns.

## While editing

- Make the smallest coherent change; preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
- Do NOT write self-evident comments — comment only non-obvious constraints or rationale (why, not what). Never write comments that justify the change or narrate what a line does.
- Never commit or create branches; leave all changes in the working tree.

## Validation

- Compile the narrowest relevant target (e.g. `./gradlew :feature:<name>:compileKotlinWasmJs`).
- Run `./gradlew detekt` — autoCorrect may reformat and fail the first run; rerun before judging. Never fix import ordering manually.

## Report

Return: changed files with a one-line summary each, validation commands with their results, and any deviation from the plan with its reason.
