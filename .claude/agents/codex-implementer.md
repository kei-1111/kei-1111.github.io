name: codex-implementer
description: Delegates a planned code change to GPT-5.6 Sol via the official OpenAI Codex CLI and reports the resulting working-tree diff. Use when an implementation plan is settled and the edit can be offloaded to Codex (the default lane in CLAUDE.md model routing), or when a skill step delegates implementation to Codex. Provide the path to a self-contained implementation brief file (goal, target files, approach, constraints). Not for planning or reviewing; use implementer instead when the change should stay on Claude.
