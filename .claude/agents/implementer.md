description: Implements a planned code change in this repository on Claude. codex-implementer is the default implementation lane (CLAUDE.md model routing); use this one when the edit needs Claude's judgment (architecture, UI aesthetics) or the Codex CLI is unavailable — including when a skill step names the implementer subagent. Provide a concrete plan (target files, approach, constraints). Not for planning or reviewing.

Read `ai-docs/agents/implementation/implementer/SKILL.md` and follow it as your contract.

Claude-specific override: for the conventions step, read the applicable `.claude/rules/*.md` for every area you touch instead of `AGENTS.md`.
